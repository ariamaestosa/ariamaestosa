<!--   ************  GETTING SETUP  *************  -->

<blockquote>

First, download the source code from the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=186987">sourceforge downloads area</A> or from SVN.<br/>
Aria is written in C++.
<br/><br/><b>Dependencies : </b>
<ul>
<li/> GCC (g++). Included in the developer tools on OS X, found in repositories of all distros on Linux, MinGW on Windows (VisualStudio not supported).
<li/> <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</A>. I am currently using 2.8.x on Linux/Windows, and 2.9.x trunk on OS X (because trunk has a couple printing bugs fixed)
<li/> <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</A> if you use the OpenGL renderer, which is optional (OpenGL is included by default on mac OS X)
<li/> <a href="http://www.jdkoftinoff.com/main/Free_Projects/C++_MIDI_Library/"> libjdkmidi</A> (included in the Aria source)
<li/> <a href="http://www.ambiera.com/irrxml/index.html">irrXML</A> (included in the Aria source)
<li/> On Linux/Unix systems, you need Alsa or Jack (experimental Jack support is available starting from 1.2.3).
      [On OSX/Windows, the native MIDI librairies are used so nothing needs to be installed there]
</ul>

<br/><b>Build system : </b>
<list>
<li/> <a href="http://www.scons.org/">scons</A> (included in the Aria source tree so you don't need to get it separately)
<li/> Under the OSX subdirectory, a Xcode project is available; not that you will need to run <TT>./configure.sh</TT> first in the same directory to generate
the appropriate files (note that the scons build system does work on OSX so you do not <i>need</i> to use Xcode if you're on mac)
<li/> You can also build with your favorite IDE/build system, but you'll then need to set up things yourself.
</list><br/> 

<hr/>
<br/>
<center><b>Prerequisites - Mac OS X</b></center>
<p>
You will need to install Developer Tools from the mac OS X install disc. You need OS X 10.4.
</p>
<p>
<b>Installing wxWidgets :</b> First, download and install wxWidgets. I usually build static. Don't forget to enable OpenGL support if you use wxWidgets 2.8. 
</p>
<p>
Starting from Aria 1.2, I use wxOSX 2.9.x trunk. wxWidgets 2.8 will still work but it has a couple printing-related bugs. Because wx 2.9 still has a couple bugs, patches have been included in the /OSX directory - apply them to wxWidgets before building it for better results.
</p>
<p>
Example terminal commands to build wx (read the instructions that come with wxWidgets or wxWiki for more info):<br/>
<blockquote>
<pre>cd wxMac2.x.x
mkdir osx-build &amp;&amp; cd osx-build
../configure --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin --with-regex=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin
     --with-zlib=builtin --with-expat=builtin --with-opengl --enable-unicode --disable-shared
make
sudo make install</pre></blockquote>Make sure <i>wx-config --libs</i> points to the 2.8 libs when run from a terminal. Mac OS X 10.4 comes with wxWidgets 2.5 pre-installed. It is <b>not</b> recommended to build Aria with it. If you install wxWidgets 2.8 from source, it will default to installing in /usr/local, however pre-installed 2.5 is in /usr, so be careful about conflicts. If /usr comes before /usr/local in yout PATH environment variable, you  will get the 2.5 libs. For getting 2.5 out of the way quickly, just get /usr/bin/wx-config out of the way (sudo mv /usr/bin/wx-config /usr/bin/wx-config-2.5). If your computer does not find wx-config, make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH (or pass WXCONFIG=/usr/local/bin/wx-config to scons - see explainations below).
</p>

<br/><center><b>Prerequisites - Linux</b></center>
<p>
The Linux version has been tested less than the mac one but appears to be getting more stable. At this point, you might want to build it to help me test it - it might also be stable enough for production but no promise :) Midi on Linux is especially painful, synthesizers like TiMidity haven't been maintained for years, eat a lot of CPU and don't play nicely with PulseAudio. In the future I will consider alternative implementations.<br/>
<br/>You will need Python, Alsa (including -dev packages if your distro uses them), wxGTK (wxWidgets), OpenGL (if you wish to use the OpenGL renderer, and also get -dev packages if any), gcc/g++ (build-essential in Ubuntu). For midi playback, you will need a softsynth like Timidity with a soundbank (more info below)
</p>
<p>
<b>Installing wxWidgets : </b> You can simply download wxWidgets 2.8 from your distribution's repositories. It needs OpenGL support enabled if you want to use the OpenGL renderer, and should be Unicode. Don't forget to install -dev packages if your distribution uses them.
<br/><br/>If you want to build wxWidgets from source, you can use commands like (read the instructions that come with wxWidgets or wxWiki for more info):<br/>
<blockquote>
<pre>cd wxGTK2.8.x<br/>mkdir gtk-build &amp;&amp; cd gtk-build<br/>../configure --with-opengl --enable-unicode<br/>make<br/>sudo make install</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Make sure <i>wx-config --libs</i> points to the 2.8 libs when run from a terminal. If it does not, it is likely that your distribution's wxWidgets (in /usr/) is picked up before the one you built (in /usr/local/). To fix this, you can pass WXCONFIG=/usr/local/bin/wx-config to scons when building - more info below.
</p>
<br/>

<center><b>Prerequisites - Windows</b></center>
<p>
Install MinGW. You'll need Python if you wish to use the scons build system (and update your PATH env variable if you wish to invoke python
from the terminal without using the full path).
</p>
<br/>

<b>Installing wxWidgets : </b> Build using MinGW. You can use a command like :
<blockquote><pre>
cd "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw"
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc UNICODE=1 SHARED=0 MONOLITHIC=0 BUILD=release
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Check the wxWidgets READMEs or the wxWiki for more information.
You will also need to install the Windows version of wx-config (a binary is included in CodeLite packages so you can rip it from there).
</p>

<br/>
<!--   ************  COMPILING  *************  -->
<hr/>

<br/>
<center><b>Compiling Aria (OS X / Linux)</b></center>
<p>
You are now ready to build Aria itself. All you need to do is type the command appropriate for your system :
<br/>
<blockquote><pre>
python scons/scons.py
</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
This will do a release build with default wxWidgets. Issue <i>python scons/scons.py --help</i> for a summary of all possible options, like to get a debug build or to use a different wxWidgets build.
</p>
<br/>
<center><b>Compiling Aria (Windows)</b></center>
<p>
The command may need to be adapted a little, depending on your enviroment. Here are a few examples :

<blockquote><pre>
python.exe scons/scons.py WXCONFIG="C:\wx-config --debug=no --static=yes --prefix=C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10" renderer="wxwidgets"  WX_HOME="C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\"
python.exe scons/scons.py WXCONFIG="C:\wx-config  --prefix=C:\wxWidgets-2.9.1 --wxcfg=gcc_dll\mswud" renderer="wxwidgets"  WX_HOME="C:\wxWidgets-2.9.1\"
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Adapt the path to "wx-config" and to your wxWidgets build as needed. Modify the flags given to wx-config to get the right build if you have
many wxWidgets builds.
</p>

<br/>

<!--   ************  FINISHING  *************  -->
<br/>

<b><center>Finishing on OS X</center></b>
<p>
    You can make a mac OS X app bundle with the following command:
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
        python scons/scons.py install
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
</p>

<b><center>Finishing on Linux</center></b>
<b>Getting a MIDI synthesizer</b>
<p>
    If it is not already the case, you will need to install a softsynth like Timidity configured with flags :
    
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
        ./configure --enable-audio=alsa --enable-server --enable-alsaseq
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    
    And you also need a soundbank (many distros will ship FreePats in their repos).
    And finally run the synth as an Alsa daemon with commands (in the case of Timidity) :
    
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
      timidity -iA -Os -EFreverb=0
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    
    <TT>-EFreverb=0</TT> disables reverbering because it tends to cause problems, but you can leave that
    part out if you computer is very fast.
    <br/>
    
    Unfortunately, if you use PulseAudio, there are known compatibility issues with the timidity daemon.
    In particular, running the Timidity daemon at startup as part of init.d seems to cause a lot of issues.
    <br/><br/>
    Newer versions of Aria have an item in the preferences that, if enabled, will make Aria automatically
    launch TiMidity and pick a port. This should make the process a little more enjoyable, even though
    audio on Linux still seems to remain very difficult to handle =( So I'm afraid getting Aria to run on
    Linux can be a little pain because of the Linux audio maze. Sorry, I'll try to support other midi
    synths than TiMidity/Alsa in the future.
</p>
<br/>

<b>Running in-place</b>
<p>
    At this point, if you are happy with letting Aria live in this folder, you can simply run it with
    <TT>./Aria</TT>
</p>

<br/>
<b>Installing</b>
<p>
    You can also install Aria into /usr/local/ by running the following command as root :

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
        python scons/scons.py install
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    Or, to specify an install prefix :

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
        python scons/scons.py install prefix=/usr/
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    You can uninstall it later if you want with
    
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
        python scons/scons.py uninstall prefix=/usr
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    Don't forget to specify the prefix it was installed into if it is not the default one.
    <br/><br/>

    Then, to open Aria, type <TT>Aria</TT> in a terminal. Hopefully all will be fine!
</p>
<br/>

<b>Register Aria using Freedesktop standards</b>
<p>
    On a further note, you may also run script <TT>installMimeType.sh</TT> found under the
    <TT>/Freedesktop</TT> directory to register Aria Maestosa files associations using the freedesktop
    standard. This script will also install the <TT>.desktop</TT> file for Aria in <TT>/usr/share/</TT>
    (this path is not configurable currently, sorry, efit the file if you want to install it somewhere else)
</p>
<br/>

<b><center>Finishing on Windows</center></b>
<p>
    If your wxWidgets build is a DLL build, copy the DLL(s) into the same directory as Aria so they are
    found.
