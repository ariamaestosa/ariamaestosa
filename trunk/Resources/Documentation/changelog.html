 - Began trying to get it work on Linux. i wrote a very basic Timidity player, just so that there's something to test. But (at least on my PPC ubuntu dual-boot), things were drawn wrong in the OpenGL pane, wxBitmapButtons were empty, keyboard input was mapped to the wrong keys, pop-up menus didn't answer. If a Linux programmer wants to take a look at it, the basic infrastructure is there though.)<br/>
