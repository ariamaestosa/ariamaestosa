    """Class for scanning LaTeX files for included files.

    Unlike most scanners, which use regular expressions that just
    return the included file name, this returns a tuple consisting
    of the keyword for the inclusion ("include", "includegraphics",
    "input", or "bibliography"), and then the file name itself.  
    Based on a quick look at LaTeX documentation, it seems that we 
    need a should append .tex suffix for the "include" keywords, 
    append .tex if there is no extension for the "input" keyword, 
    but leave the file name untouched for "includegraphics." For
    the "bibliography" keyword we need to add .bib if there is
    no extension. (This need to be revisited since if there
    is no extension for an "includegraphics" keyword latex will 
    append .ps or .eps to find the file; while pdftex will use 
    other extensions.)
