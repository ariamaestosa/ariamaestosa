   (Both of these features in hope of getting Aria to compile and run on Linux, even if not yet usable to an end-user.
	When trying to compile on my PPC linux, things were drawn wrong in the OpenGL pane, wxBitmapButtons were empty,
	keyboard input was mapped to the wrong keys. If a Linux programmer wants to take a look at it, the basic infrastructure is there though.)
