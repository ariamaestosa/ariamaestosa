  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************
 
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support
 - new control editor
 - notation printing and export
 - riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
  
************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

  - key is not saved to midi files
  
  - when saving, don't delete current file, save to another location then swap
  
 - tab exporter:
		skip series of empty measures
		more than one track
		show tuning on tab
 
 - know what happens when adding too much channels in auto mode

 * allow setting notes sharp/flat in a graphical way

 - change whole track pitch/volume
 
  - show song duration
 
 - copy control events along notes
 
 - tabbing though fields in select notes dialog should select their content
 - too easy for top bar stuff to gain focus - enter should have focus go back to main pane
 
 - set default volume
 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
 
 - multiple program changes
 - precise tempo bend (not controller-like, more like a sudden change)
 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
 
 - white space below chords in guitar editor should not be 'dead' as it is now (e.g. should be able to start selection from there)

 - general code layout could be improved, e.g. measure bar is in GUI but does tons of calulation
  
 - doesnt handle when there's too many songs open for all to be visible
 
 
 UNSURE:
 - guess key feature
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple tracks per channel, multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - only render areas that actually need it
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - use auto_ptr/parent_ptr/something like that... make it clear what pointer "hold" the object and wich ones are only conveniance shortcuts
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 subtails (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible) 
 
 ************************* BUGS: *************************
  
 - unsure note length is okay with measure != 4/4. check forumlae on wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols

 ## CAN'T REPRODUCE:
 ## crash when opening file by double-clicking on it and aria is currently closed (can't reproduce)
 ## switching to score editor while playback causes crash (can't reproduce)
 ## scale doesn't always work (no clue why... multiple time sig changes? midi imported? multiple docs open?) (can't reproduce)
 ## can't undo 'paste'
 ## awake.mid : crash near the end
 ## crash when emptying tempo in control view [reported, not tested] 
 
* copy/paste in controller mode (or at least disable them!) 

+ beaming choose a maximal number of notes per beam (e.g. 4 1/8 in 4/4 measures) but if you put like 5 or 6 of them in a row,
  it doesn't always do wise choices regarding wich ones should be beamed (i.e. it doesn't consider beats)
+ test score editor in non-4/4 measures
+ loading a key from a file probably won't appear in keyboard editor
+ accidentals should last entire measure
+ score editor - sharp of flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar
+ 1/8 notes shouldn't be beamed by groups of tree in 3/4 measures
- in a chord that lasts 2 4/4 measures, each note of the chord has its own tie

+ rearrange notes doesn't always undo correctly
+ note splitting should be wiser (like silences... complete beat)

- render a bit less often to be easier on processor
+ stop rendering when red playback line is no more visible

- drum editor... cannot start selection below drums (when only used ones are shown)
- sometimes pasting in guitar editor gives wrong notes
- clicking on a note should play it and it doesn't always work (like when note is selected)
- at the very top, in keyboard editor, wrong notes are greyed out
- when changing measure length, song length becomes wrong
- probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
- import midi. save to aria. no name suggested.
- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally
- switching tracks tends to deselect measures
- accentuated characters in copyright/song title gets broken (and possibly track name too) UTF-8 doesn't seem to work either
- importing midis exported by aria have a blank track 0
- reordering tracks should be nicer
- hard to resize last track
- hitting space when nothing is selected should do nothing
- controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track
- if you select measures, but move your mouse outside measure pane before releasing, you get nothing
   
  - tab export sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
  - tab exporter does not always respect max line width (e.g. underwater light)
  - tab exporter has problems with notes that are not snapped to large grids (e.g. arpeggio beginning of vers le soleil)
  - tab exporter long note exception applies only to perfect wholes and halves... there are other long notes
  - repetition length > 2 gives weird results
  - tab exporter doesnt respect max line width if one measure is longer than max
  - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
  - tab export : repeatd measures need measure numbers
  
 
 MINOR / CLEANUP :
- decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup
 
 - bug when repeatedly pressing play and space at the same time
 
 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch
 
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not be not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
