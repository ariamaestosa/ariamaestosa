  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************

 - notation printing and export (WIP)
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support/better synths support (fluidsynth?)
 - new control editor
		- precise values
        - special mode for on/off controllers (e.g. sustain)
		- points and curves, splines
		- make portamento more usable
		- copy/paste
		- many controller effects would gain from being accessible somewhere else than in control editor
		- copy control events along notes
		- wide pitch bends
		- should maybe appear under current editor? it's always useful to see the notes when applying effects
        - support fine values
        - support wide pitch-bend
 - non-linear/riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - allow using another renderer than OpenGL
 - multiple program changes
 - changes to song should be heard if done while playing
 - show more than one editor at once

************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

 + shift+arrows move notes by 1 octave (vertically) or by 1 measure (horizontally)

 + in preferences : turn off linear view by default
 
 + make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)
   - add new tools, that allow adding notes without dragging (and resizing without keyboard, and selecting, and...?) ?
   - add keyboard shortcut to change note length

 - allow shift-clicking in measure bar to select more measures

 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - background choices are not saved to .aria files

 - when scaling entire song, scale control events and time sig changes too

 + linux : export to wav when not using timidity?
 + linux : offer to launch timidity deamon if it's not running
 + linux : proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

 - elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

 - change whole track pitch/volume

 + reordering tracks should be nicer

 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
 - cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)

 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode

 UNSURE/MINOR:
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible)

 ************************* BUGS: *************************

* frets over 9 in tab editor don't display nice anymore

* rounding errors with vertical lines when zooming

The score ends a bit too early (at the beginning of the last count of the last measure, instead of just after the end), which gives as result that a note that ends at the last count of the last measure cannot be entered using a mouse drag.

The playback sometimes ends prematurely. You can heat this for example if you enter a single percussion "crash" sound. It might be a bug in the MIDI routines; in this case it will be a bit harder to fix.

* score print :
    - add non-linear printing...
    - repetitions never detected in multi-track printing
    - when there's small lines above/below score, the vertical measure line continues beyond the score
    - show G/F clef + key signature
    - if you show both F and G keys, both are given equal vertical space, even though one may need more than another
    - show time sig on printed scores/tabs
    - skip series of empty measures
    - allow setting font size, number of lines per page, zoom, etc...
    - Show ottava bassa/alta signs

repetition detection:
    - sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
    - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
    - repeated measures need measure numbers too
    - sometimes uses, in repetitions, measures numbers that do not appear on the tab (that are inside a previous repetition)

* crash when cancelling printing (wx bug?)

+ score editor - sharp or flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar

- when stopping play with spacebar, pause button remains (only on my old PPC?)
- crashes when opening 2+ files from the finder (can't reproduce)

- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- hard to resize last track

 - in manual channel management mode, it's still a bit too easy to get multiple tracks on the same channel with different isntruments
    (for instance by switching to and from drum editor, etc.)

 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events

 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

 - controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track (would be fixed if control editor appears under current editor)
 - class ScalePicker in /Dialogs... should be renamed ScaleDialog, or moved
 - tuningpicker and tuningdialog should be 2 separate things

 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
  - decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?

 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch

 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
