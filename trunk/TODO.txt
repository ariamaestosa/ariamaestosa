  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************
 
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support
 - new control editor
 - notation printing and export
 - riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - allow using another renderer than OpenGL
  
************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

  - key is not saved to midi files
  - when saving, don't delete current file, save to another location then swap
  - copy/paste support in controller mode
  
 - tab exporter:
		skip series of empty measures
		more than one track
		show tuning on tab
 
 - know what happens when adding too much channels in auto mode

 * allow setting notes sharp/flat in a graphical way

* make more features accessible graphcially (as opposed to keyboard-only)

 - change whole track pitch/volume
 
  - show song duration
 
 - copy control events along notes
 
 - what to do with sustain? needs all_sound_off perhaps?
 - make portamento more usable
 
 - tabbing though fields in select notes dialog should select their content
 - too easy for top bar stuff to gain focus - enter should have focus go back to main pane
 
 - set default volume
 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
 
 - multiple program changes
 - precise tempo bend (not controller-like, more like a sudden change)
 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
 
 - white space below chords in guitar editor should not be 'dead' as it is now (e.g. should be able to start selection from there)

 - general code layout could be improved, e.g. measure bar is in GUI but does tons of calulation
  
 - doesnt handle when there's too many songs open for all to be visible
 
 
 UNSURE:
 - guess key feature
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple tracks per channel, multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - only render areas that actually need it
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - use auto_ptr/parent_ptr/something like that... make it clear what pointer "hold" the object and wich ones are only conveniance shortcuts
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 subtails (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible) 
 
 ************************* BUGS: *************************
  
 ## CAN'T REPRODUCE:
 ## scale doesn't always work (no clue why... multiple time sig changes? midi imported? multiple docs open?) (can't reproduce)
 ## can't undo 'paste'
 ## crash when emptying tempo in control view [reported, not tested] 

* undoing sign changes in score doesn't quite work (at least when using shift+arrows)
* test new preferences deleting on mac + new preferences look

- setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)

+ do something if opening docs fail!

+ scons install on mac uses stupid commands to strip SVN files. use "find . -name ".svn" -exec rm -rf '{}' \;" instead

+ when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

+ show better warning message when language selected is not supported by OS

+ "select alsa midi port", guitar tunings, are not translatable

+ what's up with glutInit? wxGlCanvas seems to call it. Crashes suse 10.1.

- if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
- hitting space should work even if focus is in top bar

- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note tail if in a group... behind silence... etc.)

+ linux: scons install fails from SVN because docs are not found
+ linux: no need to install icns files, nor lprojs
- linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?

+ unsure note length is okay with measure != 4/4. check forumlae on wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols
+ loading a key from a file probably won't appear in keyboard editor
+ accidentals should last entire measure
+ score editor - sharp of flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar
- in a chord that lasts 2 4/4 measures, each note of the chord has its own tie

+ rearrange notes doesn't always undo correctly

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- render a bit less often to be easier on processor
- probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them

- sometimes pasting in guitar editor gives wrong notes
- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- clicking on a note should play it and it doesn't always work (like when note is selected)
- at the very top, in keyboard editor, wrong notes are greyed out
- import midi. save to aria. no name suggested.
- switching tracks tends to deselect measures
- accentuated characters in copyright/song title gets broken (and possibly track name too) UTF-8 doesn't seem to work either
- importing midis exported by aria have a blank track 0
- reordering tracks should be nicer
- hard to resize last track
- hitting space when nothing is selected should do nothing
- controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track
- if you select measures in the measure bar, but move the cursor below measure pane before releasing, you get nothing
   
  - tab export sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
  - tab exporter does not always respect max line width (e.g. underwater light)
  - tab exporter has problems with notes that are not snapped to large grids (e.g. arpeggio beginning of vers le soleil)
  - tab exporter long note exception applies only to perfect wholes and halves... there are other long notes
  - repetition length > 2 gives weird results
  - tab exporter doesnt respect max line width if one measure is longer than max
  - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
  - tab export : repeatd measures need measure numbers
  
 
 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
- decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?
 
 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch
 
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not be not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
