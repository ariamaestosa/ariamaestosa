  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************

 - notation printing and export (WIP)
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - show more than one editor at once for the same track
 * new control editor
		- precise values
        - special mode for on/off controllers (e.g. sustain)
		- points and curves, splines (how to handle imported midis?)
		- make portamento more usable
		- copy/paste
		- many controller effects would gain from being accessible somewhere else than in control editor
            - tying control events to notes
            - copy control events along notes
            - (how to handle imported midis?)
		- should appear under current editor. it's always useful to see the notes when applying effects
        - support fine values
        - support wide pitch-bend (MIDI 2.0)
 - non-linear/riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - multiple program changes
 - mod support/better synths support (fluidsynth?)
 - changes to song should be heard if done while playing

************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

* score print :
    * red images
      - relative sizing of notes (shorter notes appear shorter, etc.) is not 100% polished
      - accidentals : extra space allocated for them needs polish, sometimes it's too much, sometimes not enough, etc.
      - empty area at the beginning of a measure is relative and not absolute (can thus be too big)
      [ok?] dotted silences don't receive enough space, or are drawn too much to the right
      - vertical spacing between tracks needs to adapt depending on stuff near the top and bottom of scores
        (triplet symbols, stems, G clef top and bottom, etc...)
      - 1/32 silences need a proper image
      - when a track first appears, we need its clef, key, etc. (maybe even once a page). Right now it's only
        given if the said track starts playing at measure 1  (or in the first line)
      - tab tuning : letters overlap a bit
      - vertically close notes overlap
      - the left part of the score is, where the key is given, can be much too large (this is because the size
        is given in relatiev units, not in pixels, so i can't go below the number of units that work with the
        smallest possible unit size)
    - X notes not printed right
    ? allow setting font size, number of lines per page, zoom, etc...
    * non-linear printing
        * leave room for silences in tab mode too (and draw them?)
    * long-term : in multi-track printing, some tracks need to be visually more tightly bound toghether (like tab and its score)
 - show silences in tabs too
 - printing : skip series of empty measures ?
 - very short song (a few measures) : nothing printed [can't reproduce anymore]
 - when hiding empty lines during printing, if a track doesn't appear at the top of the page, you never see its key and clef
 - hiding empty lines should be configurable
 - score print : time sig changes : no bar should appear adter time sig change

 * Keyboard editor : show current key in left area
 
 * copy entire measures through measure bar
 
 * show full file path of file in tab tooltip?

 * show which files have unsaved changes
 
 + resize note with drag-and-drop
 
 + contextual menu on right-click (copy, paste, track props, ...)
 + Include sample files along Aria?
 
 + Pouvoir commencer ˆ jouer le morceau pas forcement au dŽbut ni le terminer forcŽment ˆ la fin
   (sans passer par une sŽlection puis espace) : systme de 2 curseurs ˆ placer en haut (and add *loop*)
 
 + Afficher un chronomtre qui s'incrŽmente lorsque le morceau est jouŽ
 + Gestion de la molette, par exemple ainsi : molette = dŽplacement vertical ; molette + shift : dŽplacement horizontal ; molette + ctrl : zoom


 + make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)
 - elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

 - allow shift-clicking in measure bar to select more measures

 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - background choices are not saved to .aria files

 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
 
 - when scaling entire song, scale control events and time sig changes too

 + linux : export to wav when not using timidity?
 + linux : offer to launch timidity deamon if it's not running
 + linux : proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

 - change whole track pitch/volume

 + reordering tracks should be nicer

 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
 - cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)

 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode

 UNSURE/MINOR:
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it (use wxPopupTransientWindow ?)
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible)

 ************************* BUGS: *************************
 
* i18n might have been broken by preferences updates... verify
 
* score editor at wrong octave
 
* red selection color in score editor should dim when switching to another track
 
* closing manual view with Cmd-W shuts down Aria
 
* problem with render being being rendered one time out of two... :( (hard to reproduce)

* red images

repetition detection:
    - sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
    - x2 can appear on new line...
    - repeated measures need measure numbers too
    - sometimes uses, in repetitions, measures that are not printed (that are inside a previous repetition)

* crash when cancelling printing (wx bug?)

+ score editor - sharp or flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar
- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)

- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- hard to resize last track

 - in manual channel management mode, it's still a bit too easy to get multiple tracks on the same channel with different instruments
    (for instance by switching to and from drum editor, etc.)

 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

 - controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track (would be fixed if control editor appears under current editor)
 - class ScalePicker in /Dialogs... should be renamed ScaleDialog, or moved
 - tuningpicker and tuningdialog should be 2 separate things

 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
  - decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?

 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch

 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
