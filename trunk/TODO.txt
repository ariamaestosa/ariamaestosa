  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************
 
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support
 - new control editor
 - notation printing and export
 - riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - allow using another renderer than OpenGL
 - multiple program changes
  
************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

  * guess key feature

  * add new tools, that allow adding notes without dragging-
  * add triplet as a widget, not as a check menu
  * use note icons instead of e.g. "1/8" as text

  - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
  - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
  - background choices are not saved to .aria files
  
 * tab exporter:
		skip series of empty measures
		more than one track
		show tuning on tab

 - when scaling entire song, scale control events and time sig changes too

// ----- controller editor ------
* better controller editor! precise values, etc.
 - what to do with sustain? needs all_sound_off perhaps?
 - make portamento more usable
 + copy/paste
 + many controller effects would gain from being accessible somewhere else than in control editor
 - copy control events along notes
 - precise tempo bend (not controller-like, more like a sudden change)
// ---------------

+ linux : export to wav when not using timidity?

+ proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)

 + make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)

 + cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)
 + elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

 + if you select measures in the measure bar, but move the cursor below measure pane before releasing, you get nothing
    (same with all tracks, rework event handling? determine where click goes on mouse down, and always use same destination on mouse drag?)
    (use CaptureMouse to allow drags to continue off-screen?)
   
 - change whole track pitch/volume
 
 - show song duration

 - tabbing though fields in select notes dialog should select their content
 
 + reordering tracks should be nicer
 
 - set default volume
 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it

 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
 
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 
 
 
 UNSURE:
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - use auto_ptr/parent_ptr/something like that... make it clear what pointer "holds" the object and wich ones are only conveniance shortcuts
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible) 
 
 ************************* BUGS: *************************
    
* "follow playback" : hard to follow when horizontal scrolling is changed (Change only on measure change?)

+ some of the newer classes don't use leak check

* undos in guitar editor that rely on string and fret will be wrong if tuning changed meanwhile

* red images
* crash when cancelling printing (wx bug?)
- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

+ when printing to tablature, and exporting to PDF, suggested name defaults to "aria maestosa" (wx limitation?)

- what's up with glutInit? wxGlCanvas seems to call it. Crashes suse 10.1.
- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)
+ score editor - sharp of flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- hard to resize last track

  - tab export sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
  - tab exporter long note exception applies only to perfect wholes and halves... there are other long notes
  - repetition length > 2 gives weird results
  - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
  - tab export : repeated measures need measure numbers

 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - in manual channel management mode, it's still a bit too easy to get multiple tracks on the same channel with different isntruments
    (for isntance by switching to and from drum editor, etc.)
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.
    
 - controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track
 - class ScalePicker in /Dialogs... should be renamed ScaleDialog, or moved
- tuningpicker and tuningdialog should be 2 separate things

 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
- decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?
 
 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch
 
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
