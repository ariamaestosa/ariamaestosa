  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************

== Pie in the sky ==
 - changes to song should be heard if done while playing

************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

* It would be nice to be able to click on the record button, but activate the recording with the first note that is sent to Aria through the MIDI interface

* High DPI support

* Add clicktrack/metronome
    * Add sound selection to preferences (+ option to have a different sound on first measure beat?
                                         (+ option to have a different sound on half-beats?)
    * Add "enabled by default" option to preferences

* score print :
    * red images
    - X notes not printed right (nor handled correctly in score editor anyway)
- add double bar at the end of the song
- make "print track name" configurable?
- print copyright data under title?
- long-term : in multi-track printing, some tracks need to be visually more tightly bound toghether (like tab and its score)
? allow setting font size, number of lines per page, zoom, etc...

* Keyboard shortcuts to change currently selected note length
 
+ move make_release.sh under OSX/
+ move documentation out of resources?
+ resize note with drag-and-drop
 
+ contextual menu on right-click (copy, paste, track props, ...)
+ Include sample files along Aria?
 
- elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

+ linux : export to wav when not using timidity?
+ linux : proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

- change whole track pitch/volume

- change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
- select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
- show full file path of file in tab tooltip?

UNSURE/MINOR:
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible)

************************* BUGS: *************************

* New way to store preferences (with strings instead of integers)
  messes up on Windows (encoding issue?) [can't reproduce]


* red images


 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties

 - FIXMEs
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
