  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************

== 1.3 ==
- Midi instrument support (record from keyboard, play to keyboard)
- Fix pitch IDs and other cleanups
- Allow showing several editors at once
- Multiple instrument changes per track

== 2.0 ==
- plug-in system (and move some features to plugins)
    - plugin ideas :
        * music theory/hearing/practice plugin
        * song analysis plugin (make midi from audio)
        * guitar tuner
        * MIDI event lister
        * re-arrange tablature to be easier to play
        * chord builder
        * stand-alone metronome
- better synth support (go beyond midi)
    * fluidsynth
    * gervill
    * audio units
    * mod-like samples
    * other ideas?
- better control editor
    * nodes, curves
- guitar pro support
- non-linear editing (a repeating chorus should not require copy-and-paste)

== Pie in the sky ==
 - changes to song should be heard if done while playing

************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

* Add clicktrack/metronome
    * Add sound selection to preferences (+ option to have a different sound on first measure beat?
                                         (+ option to have a different sound on half-beats?)
    * Add "enabled by default" option to preferences

* Test Actions with Unit tests

* Add gutar tuning user-defined presets

* remember printing orientation

* Custom Key editor :
    - add 'select all', 'select none'
    - when performing changes in one of the two editors, mirror them in the other?

* When a .aria file causes trouble during loading, show a warning message, don't just print errors to the terminal

* score print :
    * red images
    - X notes not printed right (nor handled correctly in score editor anyway)
- add double bar at the end of the song
- make "print track name" configurable?
- print copyright data under title?
- long-term : in multi-track printing, some tracks need to be visually more tightly bound toghether (like tab and its score)
? allow setting font size, number of lines per page, zoom, etc...

* Allow setting, in G+F score, whether each note is in the G or F clef

* Keyboard editor : show current key in left area
* In score and tab editors, show more clearly where you can click to hear the note
 
* Allow 8va to be applied to only some parts of track
 
* OS X : allow sending playback to an external MIDI device (e.g. keyboard)
 
* Keyboard shortcuts to change currently selected note length
 
* copy entire measures through measure bar
 
* show which files have unsaved changes
 
+ move make_release.sh under OSX/
+ move documentation out of resources?

 
+ find dialog should have options greyed out if brought up with no selected note
 
+ resize note with drag-and-drop
 
- when closing last tab, show a "welcome screen" instead of exiting?
 
+ contextual menu on right-click (copy, paste, track props, ...)
+ Include sample files along Aria?
 
+ Pouvoir commencer ˆ jouer le morceau pas forcement au dŽbut ni le terminer forcŽment ˆ la fin
  (sans passer par une sŽlection puis espace) : systme de 2 curseurs ˆ placer en haut (and add *loop*)
 
+ Afficher un chronomtre qui s'incrŽmente lorsque le morceau est jouŽ
+ Gestion de la molette, par exemple ainsi : molette = dŽplacement vertical ; molette + shift : dŽplacement horizontal ; molette + ctrl : zoom


+ make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)
- elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

- allow shift-clicking in measure bar to select more measures

- .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
- .aria files don't remember docked tracks
- background choices are not saved to .aria files

- song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
- when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
 
- when scaling entire song, scale control events and time sig changes too

+ linux : export to wav when not using timidity?
+ linux : offer to launch timidity deamon if it's not running
+ linux : proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

- change whole track pitch/volume

+ reordering tracks should be nicer

- shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
- cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)

- change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
- select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
- show full file path of file in tab tooltip?

UNSURE/MINOR:
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it (use wxPopupTransientWindow ?)
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible)

************************* BUGS: *************************

* New way to store preferences (with strings instead of integers)
  messes up on Windows (encoding issue?) [can't reproduce]

** Things like changing global tempo, changing song length, etc... are not actions and thus do not mark the
   document as having unsaved changes!
** Add Time Sig change is not an action and is not undone

** Printing a song that has notes after the "official" song ending can cause assertion failures

** Shift+left/Shift+right may cause asertion failures if trying to move notes past the official end of the song

* Undoing "delete track" places it back at the bottom, not where it was

* Sequence::setTempo / getTempo may get out of sync if first event is edited through controller editor!!

* score editor at wrong octave
 
* red selection color in score editor should dim when switching to another track

* red images

repetition detection:
    - sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
    - x2 can appear on new line...
    - repeated measures need measure numbers too
    - sometimes uses, in repetitions, measures that are not printed (that are inside a previous repetition)

* crash when cancelling printing (wx bug?)

+ score editor - sharp or flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar
- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)

- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- hard to resize last track

 - in manual channel management mode, it's still a bit too easy to get multiple tracks on the same channel with different instruments
    (for instance by switching to and from drum editor, etc.)

 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

 - controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track (would be fixed if control editor appears under current editor)

 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
  - decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?

 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch

 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
