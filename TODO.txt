  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************
 
 - notation printing and export (WIP)
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support/better synths support (fluidsynth?)
 - new control editor
		- precise values
        - special mode for on/off controllers (e.g. sustain)
		- points and curves, splines
		- make portamento more usable
		- copy/paste
		- many controller effects would gain from being accessible somewhere else than in control editor
		- copy control events along notes
		- wide pitch bends
		- should maybe appear under current editor? it's always useful to see the notes when applying effects
        - support fine values
 - support wide pitch-bend
 - non-linear/riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - allow using another renderer than OpenGL
 - multiple program changes
 - changes to song should be heard if done while playing
 - show more than one editor at once
  
************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************

 * add new tools, that allow adding notes without dragging (and resizing without keyboard, and selecting, and...?)

 * Button to maximize track

 * make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)
 
 * elements you get from clicking on the left area should appear in the main menubar too

 + Show ottava bassa/alta signs, especially when printing

 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - background choices are not saved to .aria files

 - when scaling entire song, scale control events and time sig changes too

 + linux : export to wav when not using timidity?
 + linux : offer to launch timidity deamon if it's not running
 + linux : proper ALSA port selection (in preferences?)

 + cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)

 + if you select measures in the measure bar, but move the cursor below measure pane before releasing, you get nothing
    (same with all tracks, rework event handling? determine where click goes on mouse down, and always use same destination on mouse drag?)
    (use CaptureMouse to allow drags to continue off-screen?)
   
 - change whole track pitch/volume
 
 - show song duration
 
 + reordering tracks should be nicer
 
 - set default volume
 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it

 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
 
 UNSURE/MINOR:
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 - key is not saved to midi files (the problem is that in midi key is global, in Aria it is local)
 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 + use wxNewId() ?
 - add background support in other editors than keyboard
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible) 
 
 ************************* BUGS: *************************

* undos in guitar editor that rely on string and fret will be wrong if tuning changed meanwhile
* red images
* My CoreAudio player is deprecated on OS X 10.5...

* score print :
    - measures appear very small if no note starts in them, even if some end in them
    - add non-linear printing...
    - silences are drawn in 'repetition' measures
    - when printing multiple tracks, it's not clear which ones go toghether
    - when there's small lines above/below score, the vertical measure line continues beyonf the score
    - show G/F clef + key signature
    - show time sig on printed scores/tabs
    - skip series of empty measures
    - allow setting font size, number of lines per page, zoom, etc...
	- print dialog says it takes 9999 pages or so...
    
repetition detection:
    - sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
    - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
    - repeated measures need measure numbers too
    - sometimes uses, in repetitions, measures numbers that do not appear on the tab (that are inside a previous repetition)
    
* crash when cancelling printing (wx bug?)

+ score editor - sharp or flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar

- when stopping play with spacebar, pause button remains (only on my old PPC?)
- crashes when opening 2+ files from the finder (can't reproduce)

- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- what's up with glutInit? I get double-init messages. Crashes suse 10.1.
- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- hard to resize last track

 - in manual channel management mode, it's still a bit too easy to get multiple tracks on the same channel with different isntruments
    (for instance by switching to and from drum editor, etc.)

 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
 
 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.
    
 - controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track (would be fixed if control editor appears under current editor)
 - class ScalePicker in /Dialogs... should be renamed ScaleDialog, or moved
 - tuningpicker and tuningdialog should be 2 separate things

 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
  - decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?
 
 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch
 
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
