# tar cj --exclude '.svn' --exclude '.DS_Store' --exclude '.sconsign' -f AriaSrc-1.1b6.tar.bz2 AriaSrc-1.1b6
  

  ************************* LONG TERM: *************************
 
 - ability to see other tracks in the background of the current track
 - guitar pro import
 - midi keyboard support
 - mod support
 - new control editor
 - notation printing and export
 - riff-based song editing (e.g. to repeat chorus you don't need to keep multiple copies of it)
 - allow using another renderer than OpenGL
  
************************* NEW FEATURES TO ADD: *************************


  * add new tools, that allow adding notes without dragging-
  * add triplet as a widget, not as a check menu
  * use note icons instead of e.g. "1/8" as text

  - key is not saved to midi files
  - when saving, don't delete current file, save to another location then swap
  - copy/paste support in controller mode
  
 - tab exporter:
		skip series of empty measures
		more than one track
		show tuning on tab

// ----- controller editor ------
* better controller editor! precise values, etc.
 - what to do with sustain? needs all_sound_off perhaps?
 - make portamento more usable
 + many controller effects would gain from being accessible somewhere else than in control editor
 - copy control events along notes
 - precise tempo bend (not controller-like, more like a sudden change)
// ---------------

+ linux : export to wav when not using timidity?

 - render a bit less often + probably too many paint events (duplicate ones at times) track and remove them
 - probably no need to re-render the entire screen everytime like currently done. only dirty portions should be rendered

 - use this when installing on linux : http://www.scons.org/wiki/InstallationPrefix
 
 - warn users graphically when adding too much channels in auto mode (right now only on terminal)

 + make more features accessible graphically (as opposed to keyboard-only)

 + cursor should change when hitting key modifiers (at least a select icon when hitting shift in control editor)

 + background choices are not saved to .aria files

 + show checkmark next to current key in key picker

 - change whole track pitch/volume
 
 - show song duration

 - tabbing though fields in select notes dialog should select their content
 + too easy for top bar stuff to gain focus - enter should have focus go back to main pane
 
 + reordering tracks should be nicer
 
 - set default volume
 - shift-click on a selected notes unselects it
 
 - multiple program changes
 - change volume relatively on a bunch of notes
 - select notes and all similar menu items should be disabled in controller mode
 
 - general code layout could be improved, e.g. measure bar is in GUI but does tons of calulation
  
 - setting sharp/flat sign manually sometimes doesn't work (when it's possible to display the note on a level with no sign)
 
 - doesnt handle when there's too many songs open for all to be visible
 
 
 UNSURE:
 - guess key feature
 - guitar mode - allow to paste pitch or string fret
 - hear note/drum by clicking on its name in left part
 - controllers have only coarse values (no fine value)
 - y zoom (make keyboard view more compact?)
 - draw correctly short tablature notes [don't repeat number when it's the same for several consecutive short notes?]
 - deal with multiple channels per track
 - fullscreen?
 - resize notes by dragging
 - when hitting space during a selection, finish selection before playing
 - clicking outside volume picker should close it
 - song length should automatically grow when pasting goes past the end of the song
 - only render areas that actually need it
 - fix overlapping notes that don't have the same start tick
 - use auto_ptr/parent_ptr/something like that... make it clear what pointer "hold" the object and wich ones are only conveniance shortcuts
 - the first click, that activates a track, should not deselect
 - score editor should be able to display notes with more than 2 flags (unusure... those with 2 are already so small and barely visible) 
 
 ************************* BUGS: *************************
  
* red images
* crash when cancelling printing
* copy-paste from a song to another gives wrong results if the two use different sample sizes

* opening manual doesn't always work (?)

* crashes when opening ghost of the navigator (freezes because it's reordering, and reorder code is absymally slow)

+ crash in crimson tide blue sea when scrolling in score mode (because of very long low note...)
+ crimson tide blue sea --> find out why score notes don't beam

+ in guitar editor, put 2 notes on two strings. move them down until both are on lowest string. undo and try to get back those you had in the beginning

- class ScalePicker in /Dialogs... should be renamed ScaleDialog, or moved
- tuningpicker and tuningdialog should be 2 separate things

- when wait dialog appears, you can still edit tracks and do operations that may be harmful to current process.
    yet you can't make it modal otherwise the background process stops.

- "select alsa midi port", guitar tunings, are not translatable

- what's up with glutInit? wxGlCanvas seems to call it. Crashes suse 10.1.
- aria has trouble importing the midi files it saved itself... "unsupported controller #127"

- score : flat/sharp/natural signs tend to appear obscured (behind note stem if in a group... behind silence... etc.)
+ score editor - sharp of flat notes at time=0 have their sign hidden behind grey bar

+ linux: scons install fails from SVN because docs are not found
+ linux: no need to install icns files, nor lprojs
+ unsure note length is okay with measure != 4/4. check forumlae on wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols
+ loading a key from a file probably won't appear in keyboard editor

+ rearrange notes doesn't always undo correctly

- error at startup (quicktime will not play dummy file to init it?)
        error:
        -->Mac OS error -208
        -->(null)

- "rearrange selected notes" doesn't always work optimally

- clicking on a note should play it and it doesn't always work (like when note is selected) (no event sent?)
- at the very top, in keyboard editor, wrong notes are greyed out
- switching tracks tends to deselect measures
- accentuated characters in copyright/song title gets broken (and possibly track name too) UTF-8 doesn't seem to work either

- hard to resize last track
- hitting space when nothing is selected should do nothing
- controller editor should keep drum instrument in a drum track
- if you select measures in the measure bar, but move the cursor below measure pane before releasing, you get nothing
    (same with all tracks, rework event handling? determine where click goes on mouse down, and always use same destination on mouse drag?)
   
  - tab export sometimes does 41-42 43-44 and not 41-44
  - tab exporter does not always respect max line width (e.g. underwater light)
  - tab exporter has problems with notes that are not snapped to large grids (e.g. arpeggio beginning of vers le soleil)
  - tab exporter long note exception applies only to perfect wholes and halves... there are other long notes
  - repetition length > 2 gives weird results
  - tab exporter doesnt respect max line width if one measure is longer than max
  - tab export : x2 can appear on new line...
  - tab export : repeatd measures need measure numbers

 MINOR / CLEANUP / UNSURE:
 - if a midi has control events in an empty track they might be removed during import (though what could go there? tempo events are already stored in sequence)
 - linux: exporting to audio via timidity : give better feedback about progression?
 + many Actions are only used on selected notes, yet they offer an implementation for single notes. This implementation was never tested and may be buggy
 - score : moving a sharp/flat/natural note up or down makes it lose its properties
 - when changing measure length in a song that already has midi events in it, song length becomes wrong compared to midi events
- decide a naming convention for variables
 - some drums that are not standard drumset preview fine but dont play correctly (SFX and one other. bug in QT?)
        I say bug in QT since it also seems to affect songs made in other software
 - .aria files don't remember whether drums are minimized
 - .aria files don't remember docked tracks
 - trigger coreaudio note player at startup?
 
 - FIXMEs
 - in .aria files, pitch should be midi pitch, not my reverse pitch
 
 - copyright editor should have the text field appear multiline but not accept line breaks (enter should default to activating OK button)
 - drum editor draws too many horizontal lines at bottom when you collapse sections
 - making tempo bend curve start at tick=0 might cause double event?
