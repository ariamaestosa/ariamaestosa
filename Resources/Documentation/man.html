<h2>The Menus</h2>
</div>

<p>
    <i>(Obvious menu items have been left out)</i><br/>
    <br/>
    <b>File &gt; New</b><br/>
    Creates a new song. It will appear as a new tab in the bar that shows currently open sequences (a la Firefox tabs). You can then
    just click on the newly appeard tab to switch to this song.<br/>
    <br/><b>File &gt; Song Info</b><br/>
    Midi files allow their author to specify information like title and copyright.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Edit &gt; Paste at cursor</b><br/>
    Pastes the selected notes near the cursor (using this item from the menu has little use of course, you need to use the keyboard
    shortcut : CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + V).<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Edit &gt; Select notes...</b><br/>
    Select notes according to criteria. Most of these criteria are based on a currently selected note. For instance, if you want to
    select all G notes, you can just select one G notes, choose this option in the menu, check "select all notes that have the same
    pitch", click OK, and it&#146;s done!<br/>
    You can also use this feature to select all notes within a range of measures (i.e. if you want to select all notes from measures
    65 to 78)<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>
    Edit &gt; Snap notes to grid</b><br/>
    Aria uses a "magnetic grid" to ensure that notes have a precise location and duration, corresponding to those of music theory.
    If you end with notes that seem to have unusual lengths/locations, select the notes, select an appropriate grid size (see below in
    track docs) and select this option.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Edit &gt; Remove Overlapping Notes</b><br/>
    If you copied a hundred notes, pasted them right on top of their original ones, and accidentally unselected them before moving them
    - all notes now have doubles! Fortunately you can just select those notes and use this feature. It can be used in other cases too -
    you get the picture.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Track &gt; Properties</b><br/>
    Lets you set the current track's properties, including (1) default volume to use for new notes, (2) background (displays notes from
    other tracks, currently works only in Piano editor).<br/><br/>
    
    <span class="center">
        <img src="docs/background.png"  alt="background"/>
    </span>
    
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Settings &gt; Follow Playback</b><br/>
    If checked, when you hit play, the scroll will scroll as the song moves on so that the currently played part is always visible on
    screen.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Settings &gt; Play during edits</b><br/>
    When you edit a song, Aria offers you to play the notes you&#146;re manipulating, without you ever pressing play. Here you can
    decide how often you want it to play these previews.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Settings &gt; Channel management</b><br/>
    Midi considers tracks and channels as two seperate entities. In the midi specs, tracks are a group of notes, whereas channels are
    where the tracks actually play their notes. This menu allows you to choose whether you want to manually be able to specify channels
    or whether you prefer that Aria hides this concept. When this is enabled, you will see a new widget appear on the track header (see
    below).

<ul>
<li>The first 2 elements are the play and stop buttons, that allow you to play the song.</li>
<li><b>Tempo</b> lets you set the tempo (speed) of the song in beats per minutes. Note that this is the initial tempo of the song,
see the Controller Editor below to see how a song can have tempo variations.</li>
<li><b>Duration</b> lets you choose the total amount of measures of your song. If you run out space in the default 12 measures,
    just add a few more
                     by clicking the arrows or typing a new number and pressing enter if necessary.</li>
<li> <b>Time Sig</b> lets you choose the time (measure) signature (either globally, if you use only one throughout the song, or for
    the currently
                    selected one, if you use multiple in advanced measure management mode). Default is 4/4.</li>
<li><b>Start</b> lets you choose the measure where the song begins. For instance, if you make a long song and are composing measure
    100, you may not want to start playing at measure 1 every time you change a note and want to hear how it sounds - you can just
    change your song to begin at, say, measure 95.<br/>
    <b><i>Tip :</i></b> You can also select where the song start by Ctrl-Clinking or Alt-Clicking in the measure bar
    </li>
<li><b>Zoom</b> lets you choose how big the notes will appear on the tracks. It is useful to make it bigger if, for instance, you
    deal with very
                short notes.</li>
<li><b>Tools</b> lets you switch between two different edit modes; the first is the "classic" edition mode where notes are added
    by "drawing them"
                 (using mouse drag-and-drop; see more below). The second tool will let you add notes of the selected length directly
                 by clicking.</li>

    <span class="center">
        <img src="docs/measurebar.png"  alt="measure bar image"/>
    </span>
    <br/><br/>
    This bar shows the number of each measure.<br/><br/>
    If you right-click near the line between two measures, a pop-up menu will appear, allowing you to insert empty measures between
    these two.<br/><br/>
    
    You can also click on a measure to select it. This will select all notes contained in this measure. You can do the same for
    multiple measures by dragging the mouse. You can deselect them by deselecting their notes, e.g. by clicking in an empty space in
    the tracks.
    
    <br/><br/>
    Ctrl-clicking or alt-clicking on a measure will also move the playback cursor to this measure, so that next time you press play
    the song starts there.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <span class="center">
        <img src="docs/selectMeasure.png"  alt="image of selecting measure"/>
    </span><br/><br/>
    Once you have selected one or many measures, you can right-click on them. This will show a pop-up enabling you to completely remove
    these measures.<br/><br/>
    
    <span class="center">
        <img src="docs/arrow.png"  alt="image of follow playback arrow"/>
    </span><br/><br/>
    While the song is playing, the current part of the song that is played may not visible because the horizontal scrollbar is placed
    to show another location. In this case, red arrows will appear at either end of the bar, telling you where current playback is
    relative to your current location. Clicking on the arrow will take you directly to the part of the song currently being played.

    If you check <b>Expanded measure management</b> in the settings menu, the measure bar will become wider and you will be able t
    change the time signature at any time during the song. To add a time signature change, just click in the lower half of the
    expanded measure bar. A new signature change event will appear. To select an event, just click on it. It will become brighter and
    bigger (see 3/4 signature at measure 2 in above picture) Clicking on the red square next to a time signature change will prompt a
    pop-up allowing you to edit the value. To remove an event, right-click on it and select <b>Remove time sig change</b>.

<h2>Tracks</h2>
</div>

<p>
    When you create a new song or just open Aria, you get one track in keyboard view. You can add and delete tracks as you wish with
    the "Tracks" menu.<br/>
    
    <br/>
    <span class="center">
        <img src="docs/track.png" alt="Tracks"/>
    </span>
    <br/><br/>
    
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/collapse.png" alt="Collpase"/> <b>Collapse</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It enables you to collapse or expand the track.
    You can collapse a track when you don&#146;t need it for now, so that it doesn&#146;t uselessy take place on the screen. When a
    track is collapsed, the editor is hidden and only the header (what you see on the screenshot) remains. You can bring the track
    back by clicking again on the same triangle.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/track_volume.png" alt="mute"/> <b>Track volume</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allows you to select a track-wide global
    volume. For instance you can make one track quieter than another by using this.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/mute.png" alt="mute"/> <b>Mute</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It allows you to mute the track. Click on the speaker: a X
    appears on it. Next time you hit play, the track will not play anything. Click again to unmute.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/solo.png" alt="solo"/> <b>Solo</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A track marked as <i>solo</i> will be the only track heard
    when you play the sequence. Marking a track as <i>solo</i> effectively mutes all other tracks. Click again to remove.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/dock.png" alt="Dock"/> <b>Maximize or Dock</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you definitely don&#146;t need a track for
    some time, you can click on the second button (down arrow). This track will completely disappear from the track area, moving to
    the small bar at the bottom of the window  - the Aria <i>dock</i>. When you want the track back, click on its name in the dock
    and it&#146;s back.<br/>
    If you would like to maximize a track, click on the left icon. The track will then take the whole screen. In this state, you can
    switch between tracks by using the bar at the bottom. <br/>
    <br/>
    The long text area with "Untitled" in it is the <b>name of the track</b>. Click on it, and enter any name you like.<br/>
    <br/>
    The combo box that contains notes is the <b>magnetic grid size</b>. The magnetic grid allows you to snap notes durations and
    locations to standard musical theory ones. In this combo box, you can choose the smallest note precision you want to use right now,
    simply by clicking on it. You can also click on the triplet icon to toggle triplets on or off. Click on the arrows of the combo
    for more choices.<br/>

    <b>Editor</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indicate the current editor (how the notes are displayed and edited). You can click on the
    piano to go in piano roll mode, you can click on guitar to get a tablature view, etc. (See editors below for more info).<br/>
    <br/>
    The last field at the right of the track header is the <b>instrument</b> used to play the notes. Click on it and you will be able to
    choose any instrument from the 128 standard midi instruments, placed in various categories.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="docs/channel.jpg" alt="Channel"/> <b>Channel</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This widget will only appear if you turned channel management to manual (see Settings menu above). It allows you specify in which
    channel this track will play. (In the midi specs, there are 16 channels, 0 to 15, where channel 9 is drums).
    <br/><br/>
    You can <b>resize a track</b> by dragging its bottom.<br/>
    <br/>
    You can <b>reorder tracks</b> by grabbing (hold down the mouse on) the line marking the upper limit of a track, just above the track
    header. You will then be presented a list of all tracks, all you need to do is place the mouse at the new location and release mouse
    button.<br/><br/><br/>

    This is the default view. It shows a simple piano roll with the notes on it.<br/>
    <br/>
    To <b>add a note</b>, simply hold the mouse button down and <b>drag horizontally </b>on the track. When you release the mouse, a note
    will be placed where you clicked, with the length of your frag. Try it, it&#146;s easy! There is a preview to show you where the note
    will be when you release the mouse.<br/>
    <br/>
    To <b>select</b> <b>a single note</b>, you can simply <b>click</b> on it. Selected notes appear colored in tones of yellow/green.<br/>
    <br/>
    To <b>select many notes</b>, you can simply <b>drag</b> the mouse across the track. At first, it might look like Aria wants to add a
    new note, but don&#146;t bother. Once you have moved the mouse enough vertically, it will understand you want to select and will
    instead display a selection rectangle like you can see in all apps. All notes in the rectangle when you release the mouse will be
    selected.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have some notes already selected, and want to <b>select more</b>, hold down <b>shift</b> while selecting additionnal notes.<br/>
    If you have some notes already selected, but want to <b>unselected</b> specifically some of them, hold down <b>alt</b> and click on
    them.<br/>
    <br/>
    You can <b>play selected notes</b> by pressing <b>space bar</b>.<br/>
    <br/>
    To change the <b>volume</b> of a note, <b>right-click</b> on it. A pop-up window will appear. You can then either drag the slider or
    manually enter a value and press enter. Midi volumes range from 0 (inaudible) to 127 (loudest). If you right-click on a bunch of
    selected notes, it will set the volume for all notes. If you want to cancel entering anew volume, press escape.<br/>
    <br/>
    The color of a note also shows its volume. Loud notes are drawn darker that soft ones.<br/>
    <br/>
    To <b>move a note</b>, you can just click on it, hold the mouse button down and <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> to its new location. You can
    also drag a bunch of selected notes the same way, by dragging.<br/>
    <br/>
    Alternatively, you can <b>move selected</b> <b>notes</b> by pressing the <b>arrow keys</b> on your keyboard.<br/>
    <br/>
    To <b>change the duration</b> of one (or many) note, select it, hold down <b>command or control</b> key, and hit the<b> left or
        right arrow key</b> on your keyboard. Each time you press an arrow key, the note will be resized in the direction the arrow
        points. (Try it! It&#146;s clearer when you see it)<br/>
    <br/>
    You can <b>delete</b> selected notes by pressing <b>backspace or delete</b> keys on the keyboard.<br/>
    <br/>
    You can move notes <b>one octave up or down</b> by using <b>shift + up/down</b> keys, and to the <b>next or previous measure</b>
    with <b>shift + left/right</b> keys.
    <br/><br/>
    You may also <b>duplicate</b> notes by <b>dragging them while holding down control</b> (or <b>command</b> for OSX users).

    This editor allows you to edit your song as a guitar tablature. (If you don&#146;t know what tablature is, or don&#146;t play
    guitar, you probably won&#146;t be interested by this editor)<br/>
    <br/>
    You may want to read the section about Piano editor, since everything from Piano editor also applies in Guitar editor.<br/>
    <br/>
    In guitar editor, when you move a note up or down on the strings, it will keep the same fret number, and its pitch will adapt to
    its new string.<br/> If you want to <b>move a note vertically but keep same pitch</b> (for instance, 10 on A string has the same
    pitch as 5 on D string  and same pitch as 0 on G string) Aria can do that for you, simply select the note, <b>hold down shift, and
    hit the up or down arrow</b> key. Nothing will happen if you are trying to move a note to a string where it cannot be played.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to <b>change the fret number</b>, simply select a note a press the appropriate number key, either in the <b>num pad</b>
    at the right of the keyboard, or in the <b>numeric keys</b> at the top of the keyboard. For numbers higher than 9, you can hold down
    the shift key and press a number. For instance, shift+5 will be 15, shift+7 will give 17. You may also use keyboard shortcuts
    <b>command + up</b> (or <b>control + up</b>) and <b>command + down</b> (or <b>control + down</b>) to increase or decrease a note's
    fret number.<br/><br/>
    You can also change the <b>tuning of the guitar</b> by clicking on the string names on the left and selecting a new tuning.<br/>
    <br/>
    If some notes, mainly from an imported midi file, or that were added in another editor, don&#146;t seem to be placed on the right
    strings (e.g. many notes are played simultaneously on the same string, or a chord that could be played on 3 consecutive strings in
    split, etc.) you can also choose "<b>Rearrange selected notes</b>" from the drop-menu when you click on the left part of the editor
    (the part with string names). It will attempt to rearrange notes in a more meaningful way. (Right now this feature is not completed
    and may not always give right results, but overall it&#146;s not bad)<br/>

    Allows you to edit music with a notation closer to classical music notation. <br/>
    <br/>
    This editor works very similarly to piano editor, so if you are not used to working with keyboard editor you may want to try that
    first.<br/>
    When you move a note up or down, it will by default move it vertically to the next score line.<br/>
    If you instead want  to move a note by semi-tones (e.g. in order to introduce accidentals) simply hold down the shift key while
    pressing the up/down arrow keys. You can also use the sharp/flat/natural buttons found in the header of the track:

    display bars a bit like keyboard editor, but on the score instead. By default, both are enabled. You may activate or
    deactivate each one independently. Generally, enabling linear mode will make editing easier, while disabling it will make
    reading the score easier.</li>
<li>choose which clef(s) to use</li>
<li>More the score one octave up or down</li>

    Allows you to edit drums. When you are in this mode, the set of instruments proposed to you is different.<br/>
    <br/>
    Midi allows <b>only one drum channel per song</b>. It&#146;s okay if you use more than one drum track in Aria, however only one
    drumset can be used when playing and exporting. (For instance, you can&#146;t have a room kit in one track and an orchestral
    kit in another)<br/>
    <br/>
    You may want to read the part about Piano editor, since it mostly works the same, with the exception that drum hits don&#146;t
    have a duration. When you add a drum, no need to drag mouse, just click where you want to add a drum hit.<br/>
    <br/>
    Drums are organised in sections - you can hide a section you don&#146;t use by clicking on the little white triangle beside its
    name.<br/>
    <br/>
    
    Just above the name of the first drum is a black collapse/expand arrow. Clicking on it will hide all unused drums.

This editor is different from other editors, because it doesn&#146;t allow you to change the notes themselves, but
details of how they&#146;re played. This can be considered the "power tool" where most advanced features are
accessible.<br/>
<br/>
Through this editor, you may control <b>tempo</b>, <b>volume envelope</b>, <b>panning</b>, <b>lyrics</b>,
<b>instrument changes</b> at any time through the track, <b>pitch bend</b>, <b>reverberation</b>, etc.
<br/><br/>

Click in the grey left area of the editor to open the menu where you can select which controller you want
to edit (you may only see one type of controller at a time, but there may be more than one active)
<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="docs/controllermenu.png"/>
</div>

<br/><br/><br/>
Different types of controllers are edited slightly differently :<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Numerical controllers</b><br/><br/>
<div style="padding-left:50px">
    <p>
        Several controllers, like volume, tempo or pitch bend,
        allow you to select a value between a minimum and a maximum.<br/><br/>
        These controllers appears as a pane with a value on top and a value on the bottom.
        You can firstly add "sudden" changes with a <b>single click</b>, the horizontal position being the time where
        it happens, the vertical position being how much effect you want. In the example below, panning starts on the
        left, then switches to center on beat 2, and switches to right on measure 2.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="docs/Aria man9.jpg"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you do not want a sudden change, but rather a progressive slide, you can <b>hold down a click and drag</b>.
    This will create a line following the cursor that you can use for creating progressive effect changes.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="docs/controller_minmax.png"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You may also <b>right-click</b> anywhere in the editor to type in a specific value.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="docs/controller_rightclick.png"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As when editing notes, everything you do in the controller editor is constrained by the currently
    active magnetic grid.
    </p>
</div>

<br/><br/>

<b>On-off controllers</b><br/>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">
    <p>
    Some controllers like "Sustain" may only be on or off. Working with such controllers is very similar to
    numeric controllers described above; the main difference is that you can only add changes at the top
    and the bottom of the editor, the top being "On" and the bottom "Off"
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="docs/controller_onoff.png"/>
    </p>
</div>

<br/><br/>

<b>Misc controllers</b><br/>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">
    <p>
    Finally, there are other controllers like "Lyrics" or "Instrument" that simply work by clicking in the editor
    and you will be prompted for information relevant to the context.
    </p>

    </p>
</div>

<br/><br/>

    
<b>Selecting and erasing</b><br/>
<div style="padding-left: 50px">
    <p>
    You can <b>select</b> in all controllers by holding down the <b>shift</b> key on your keyboard and dragging. You can then delete
    the selected part by pressing backspace or delete keys on the keyboard.<br/>
    You can <b>unselect</b> the selection by holding down shift and clicking without dragging, or simply choosing "Select none" from the
    menus.
